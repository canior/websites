                content on that web site. In addition, a link to a Triton web site does not mean that Triton endorses or
                accepts any responsibility for the content, or the use, of such web site.

                (a) No changes to these terms are valid or have any effect unless agreed to by Triton in writing. Triton
                reserves the right to vary these Terms and Conditions from time to time. Triton’s new terms will be

                be bound by any changes made by Triton. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                FROM TIME TO TIME TO VERIFY SUCH CHANGES

                (c) If any part of these Terms and Conditions is unenforceable (including any provision in which Triton
                excludes or limits its liability to you) the enforceability of any other part of these Terms and
                Conditions will not be affected
                (d) Triton’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement
                shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the
                parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement.
                (e) Triton may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice
                to you.

                brought exclusively in a federal or Ontario court of competent jurisdiction sitting in Canada.
                (h) Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to the Service and/or the Site must be
                commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises or such claim or cause of action
                is barred.
